    <h1>Hecke Oprators \(T_m\)</h1>
    Hecke Operators are linear transformations on the vector space of modular forms.
    \[T_m: M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})) \rightarrow M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\]
    defined by
    \[T_m(f) = m^{k/2-1}\sum_{ad = m}\sum_{b (mod d)}f\left|\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\
    0 & d
    \end{pmatrix}\right.\]
    where \(f|\gamma\) is the usual 'slash notation'.
    <h3>More spicy formulas</h3>
    Since the dimension of the space of modular forms for a given weight k is relatively small, we can use that to our advantage and use Hecke operators to determine interesting properties about the Fourier coefficients of those modular forms. We have the following Theorem.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Theorem.</strong><em> If \(f \in M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) has q-expansion</em>
    \[f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\lambda(n)q^n\]
    <em>then the q-expansion of \(T_m(f)\) is</em>
    \[T_m(f) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{d|n,m}d^{k-1}\lambda\left(\frac{mn}{d^2}\right)\right)q^n\]
    <br>
    This formula in particular is what is used to prove the multiplicative properties of the Fourier coefficients.
    <h3>The Petersson Inner Product</h3>
    We can turn the vector spaces of modular forms into an inner product space by introducting the following inner product:
    <br>
    For \(f,g \in S_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) we define the <strong>Petersson Inner Product</strong> as
    \[(f,g) = \frac{1}{[SL_2(\mathbb{Z}): \Gamma]}{\int\int}_{\mathcal{F}}y^kf(z)\overline{g(z)}\frac{dxdy}{y^2}.\]
    where \(z = x + iy\) and \(\mathcal{F}\) is any fundamental domain for \(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\).
    <br>
    <br>
    It turns out the Hecke Operators are linear:
    \[T_m(cf + g) = cT_m(f) + T_m(g)\]
    Hecke operators are commutative:
    \[T_mT_n(f) = T_nT_m(f)\]
    And Hecke Operators are Hermition with respect to the Petersson inner product.
    \[(T_n(f), g) = (f, T_n(g))\]
    <br>
    Because of the dimension restriction stated earlier, we are able to show that the Eisenstein series are eigenfunctions with respect to the Hecke operators. We can use this fact to shwo that the space \(M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) has an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions.

  here
