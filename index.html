        Let \(\mathbb{H} =
        \{z \in \mathbb{C} : Re(z) > 0\}\) be the complex upper half plane.
        <br>
        Let \(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\
        c & d\end{pmatrix}: a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z} \textup{ and } ad-bc = 1\right\}\) be the special linear group (modular group).
        <br>
        <strong>Modular forms</strong> are analytic functions defined on the complex upper half plane \(\mathbb{H}\), that satisfy the following two conditions:
        <ol>
          <li>\(f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^kf(z)\) for some fixed \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\), for all \(z \in \mathbb{H}\), and for all \(\begin{pmatrix}
            a & b \\
            c & d \\
            \end{pmatrix} \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\).</li>
          <li>\(\exists K \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty}|f(x+iy)| < \infty\). That is, \(f\) is bounded as the argument approaches \(i\infty\).</li>
        </ol>
        The value k in the first condition is called the <strong>weight</strong> of the modular form.
        <br><br>
        The unique properties of \(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\) allow condition (1) to be reduced to two more easily verified conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>\(f(z+1) = f(z) \ \forall z \in \mathbb{H}\)</li>
          <li>\(f(\frac{-1}{z}) = z^kf(z) \ \forall z \in \mathbb{H}\) and for some fixed constant \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\)</li>
        </ul>
        We can also define modular forms for special subgroups of \(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\) called <strong>congruence subgroups</strong>, which do not fully satisfy condition 1, but satisfy it for the congruence subgroup.
        <br>
        <br>
        If a modular form \(f\) satisfies condition 2 such that \(\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty}|f(x+iy)|= 0\), we call it a <strong>cusp form</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        It follows from the definition of a modular form that if \(f\) and \(g\) are modular forms of weight k, and \(c \in \mathbb{C}\) is any scalar, then \(cf+g\) is also a modular form of weight k. Thus, modular forms of weight k form a vector space. We denote the vector space of weight k modular forms as \(M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\) and the space of weight k cusp forms as \(S_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\).

      <h1>Why Study Modular Forms?</h1>
      Modular forms have been studied by mathematicians for over 100 years!
      <br>
      <br>
      Modular forms provide an essential connection between Number Theory, Abstract Algebra, and Geometry. It is the starting place in an active area of research called the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_program>Langlands program</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Modular forms are ubiquitous in modern mathematics, and they have a vast number of interesting properties! One is compelled to study their beauty irrespective of any subdiscipline.
      <br>
      <br>
      The only prerequisites for studying modular forms are elementary number theory, linear and abstract algebra. Complex analysis is recommended but one can probably get away without taking that course.
