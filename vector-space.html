    <h1>The Space of Weight k Modular forms \(M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) and Cusp Forms \(S_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\)</h1>
    From the definition of a modular form, it is easy to see that if \(f\) and \(g\) are each modular forms of the same fixed weight k, then \(cf+g\) is also a modular form of weight k for any scalar \(c\). Thus, we deduce that the space of weight k modular forms and weight k cusp forms each form a  vector space. We denote the spaces respectively by \(M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) and \(S_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\).
    <h3>The valence and dimension formulas</h3>
    Given the fundamental domain \(\mathcal{F}\) for \(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\), we can do a line integral around the boundary of \(\mathcal{F}\) and get that for any nonzero weight k modular form \(f\), we get
    \[\nu_{i\infty}(f) + \frac{1}{2}\nu_i(f) + \frac{1}{3}\nu_{e^{4\pi i/3}}(f) + \sum_{z \in \mathcal{F} \neq i, e^{2\pi i/3}}'\nu_z(f) = \frac{k}{12}\]
    where \(\nu_{\tau}(f)\) is the order of the zero of \(f\) at \(\tau\) (which equals 0 if \(f\) is not 0 there), and the ' on the summation means we are only including half the boundary of \(\mathcal{F}\) in the summation.
    <br>
    From this (and a small fact about Ramanujan's weight 12 cusp form \(\Delta\)) we can deduce the exact dimension of the space of weight k modular forms and cusp forms for each k.
    \[\dim M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})) = \left\{\begin{matrix} \left \lfloor \frac{k}{12} \right \rfloor \textup{ if } k \equiv 2 (\textup{ mod } 12) \\
    \left \lfloor \frac{k}{12} +1 \right \rfloor \textup{ if } k \not\equiv 2 (\textup{ mod } 12)
    \end{matrix}\right.\]
    The dimension of \(S_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) is exactly 1 less than \(M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\), but no less than \(0\).
    <h3> Examples: Eisenstein series </h3>
    Since \(f(z+1) = f(z)\) for all modular forms, it follows that every modular for has a fourier expansion (q-expansion). Using some analytic number theory we can construct the fourier series for a series of even weight modular forms called <strong>Eisenstein Series</strong>. Their first 10 coefficients are given below in a table.

    These coefficients have an incredible list of interesting properties. Perhaps the most notable is that if \(m\cdot n = k\cdot l\) then \(a_ma_n = a_ka_l\).

    Using the theory of Hecke Operators, we are able to prove many more interesting properties. It turns out that \(M_k(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))\) and \(\) are actually inner product spaces and we can use Hecke operators and Eisenstein series to determine orthonormal bases for these spaces with respect to their inner product.
